# Pre-work - *Tip your server*

**Tip your server** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Steven Yang**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

I wanted to develop more features below; however, since I am new to SWIFT, I couldn't finish this. Possible improvements are:
- I wanted to add features including custom tip, setting a custom percentage.
- I wanted to make a box that the user can write their tips in $ and calculate the %.
- I wanted to add more colors.
- The total tip does not updated dynamically if the user re-enter the bill amount.
